# Kafka as your Data Lake - is it feasible?

## Demo 1 - Streaming Data Lake

This demo will show how stream processing can be used to transform raw data (events) into usage-optimised data, ready to be consumed. We will use [ksqlDB](http://ksqldb.io) as the stream processing framework, but any other would work as well.

### Connect to ksqlDB engine

Let's connect to the ksqlDB shell

``` bash
docker exec -it ksqldb-cli ksql http://ksqldb-server-1:8088
```

### Create Stream and SELECT from it

First drop the stream if it already exists:

``` sql
DROP STREAM IF EXISTS truck_position_raw_s;
```

Now let's create the ksqlDB Stream

``` sql
CREATE STREAM IF NOT EXISTS truck_position_raw_s 
  (timestamp VARCHAR, 
   truckId VARCHAR, 
   driverId BIGINT, 
   routeId BIGINT,
   eventType VARCHAR,
   latitude DOUBLE,
   longitude DOUBLE,
   correlationId VARCHAR)
  WITH (kafka_topic='truck_position',
        value_format='JSON');
```

Let's see the live data by using a `SELECT` on the Stream with the `EMIT CHANGES` clause:

``` sql
SELECT * FROM truck_position_raw_s 
EMIT CHANGES;
```

### Create a new "refined" stream where the data is transformed into Avro

First drop the stream if it already exists:

``` sql
DROP STREAM IF EXISTS truck_position_refined_s;
```

And now crate the refined ksqlDB Stream:

``` sql
CREATE STREAM IF NOT EXISTS truck_position_refined_s 
  WITH (kafka_topic='truck_position_refined',
        value_format='AVRO')
AS SELECT *
FROM truck_position_raw_s
EMIT CHANGES;
```

to check that the refined topic does in fact hold avro formatted data, let's just do a normal kcat on the `truck_position_refined` topic

``` bash
docker exec -ti kcat kcat -b kafka-1:19092 -t truck_position_refined
```

we can see that it is avro 

```
                            Normal���Q�B@ףp=

ףpE@R����V�$343671958179690963
% Reached end of topic truck_position_refined [7] at offset 355
```

we can use the `-s` and `-r` option to specify the Avro Serde and the URL of the schema registry

``` bash
docker exec -ti kcat kcat -b kafka-1:19092 -t truck_position_refined -s avro -r http://schema-registry-1:8081
```

### Create a new "usage-optimized" stream with the data filtered

In this new stream we are only interested in the messages where the `eventType` is not normal. First let's create a SELECT statement which performs the right result, using the ksqlDB CLI:

``` sql
SELECT * FROM truck_position_refined_s 
WHERE eventType != 'Normal'
EMIT CHANGES;
```

Now let's create a new stream with that information. 

``` sql
DROP STREAM IF EXISTS problematic_driving_s;

CREATE STREAM IF NOT EXISTS problematic_driving_s \
  WITH (kafka_topic='problematic_driving', \
        value_format='AVRO', \
        partitions=8) \
AS 
SELECT * 
FROM truck_position_refined_s \
WHERE eventtype != 'Normal';
```

We can see that the stream now only contains the messages filtered down to the relevant ones:

``` sql
SELECT * FROM problematic_driving_s
EMIT CHANGES;
```

We can also see the same information by directly getting the data from the underlaying kafka topic `problematic_driving`:

``` bash
docker exec -ti kcat kcat -b kafka-1:19092 -t problematic_driving -s avro -r http://schema-registry-1:8081
```

### Pull query on Stream to get "historical" data

You can select the persisted data by using a Pull-query (without the emit changes):

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM truck_position_refined_s 
WHERE eventType != 'Normal';
```

notice that this query will come to an end (as the data in this case is bounded)

```
.....
Query Completed
Query terminated
ksql>
```

you can also use the `LIMIT` clause to limit the amount of data returned:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM truck_position_refined_s 
WHERE eventType != 'Normal'
LIMIT 10;
```

However you cannot do any aggregation operations if it is a pull query.

### Create Join with Driver information, available in Kafka topic

First let's register the Kafka topic `logisticsdb_driver`, which we created and populated in the [Preparation](0-Preparation.md) section.

``` sql
set 'commit.interval.ms'='5000';
set 'cache.max.bytes.buffering'='10000000';
set 'auto.offset.reset'='earliest';

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS driver_t;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS driver_t (rowkey VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
   id BIGINT,
   first_name VARCHAR,  
   last_name VARCHAR,  
   available VARCHAR, 
   birthdate VARCHAR)  
  WITH (kafka_topic='logisticsdb_driver', 
        value_format='JSON');
```

Now with the ksqlDB table in place, let's join it with the `problematic_driving_s` ksqlDB stream to enrich it with the driver information (first_name and last_name):

``` sql
SELECT driverid, first_name, last_name, truckId, routeId ,eventType \
FROM problematic_driving_s \
LEFT JOIN driver_t \
ON CAST (problematic_driving_s.driverId AS VARCHAR) = driver_t.ROWKEY
EMIT CHANGES;
```

We can see the enriched stream live in the CLI.

How can we make that enriched dataset (data stream) available in a more permanent fashion? We do that by creating a new Stream based on the SELECT statement just issued. Stop the query by entering `CTRL-C` and execute the following statement:

``` sql
DROP STREAM IF EXISTS dangerous_driving_and_driver_s;

CREATE STREAM IF NOT EXISTS problematic_driving_and_driver_s \
  WITH (kafka_topic='problematic_driving_and_driver_ksql', \
        value_format='AVRO', \
        partitions=8) \
AS 
SELECT driver_t.ROWKEY, driverid, first_name, last_name, truckId, routeId ,eventType \
FROM problematic_driving_s \
LEFT JOIN driver_t \
ON CAST (problematic_driving_s.driverId AS VARCHAR) = driver_t.ROWKEY;
```

we can use `kcat` to show the data stream in the newly created Kafka topic `problematic_driving_and_driver_ksql` to show the enrichment in action:

``` bash
docker exec -ti kcat kcat -b kafka-1:19092 -t problematic_driving_and_driver_ksql -s avro -r http://schema-registry-1:8081
```
